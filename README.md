# Summary: As a new data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., I was tasked with compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. For this analysis, the data was produced from 249 mice who were identified to have SCC tumors and received treatment from a range of the drug regimens. The mice' tumors were observed and measured over the course of 45 days. As a starting point, I was able to combine the two datasets (mouse_meta_data.csv and study_results_path.csv) into a single dataset. From there, I cleaned the combined data to drop any duplicate mice data. With the cleaned dataframe, I calculated the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error for each drug regimen. Following my calculations, I created a bar chart to display the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen. I also created a pie plot displaying the distribution of female vs male mice tested. Then, I calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. With this information, I calculated the IQR and quantitatively determined if there were any potential outliers. I additionally created a box plot to display the distribution of the tumor volume for each treatment group.Next, I generated a line plot to show tumor volume vs timepoint for a sample mouse treated with Capomulin. I generated a scatter plot to show the average tumor volume vs mouse weight for Capomulin. Finally, I generated another scatter plot displaying the average tumor volume vs mouse weight for Capomulin, but I included the correlation coefficent and linear regression.

# Analysis: For the number of mice tested per drug regimen, Capomulin and Ramicane had the largest numbers of timpoints tested; Propriva had the lowest number of timepoints tested. The ratio of femail to male was fairly even with 51% of mice tested being female and 49% of mice tested being male. The distrubtions of Capomulin and Ramicane are less than Infobulin and Ceftamin. The Infomulin data includes an outlier. The average tumor volume and weight shows a positive correlation; as the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases. The correlation coefficient is .84.
